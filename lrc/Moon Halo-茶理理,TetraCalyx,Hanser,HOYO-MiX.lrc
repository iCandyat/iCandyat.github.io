[00:08.24]Some deserts on this planet were oceans once
[00:15.23]Somewhere shrouded by the night, the sun will shine
[00:22.24]Sometimes I see a dying bird fall to the ground
[00:29.15]But it used to fly so high
[00:35.09]
[00:35.20]I thought I were no more than a bystander till I felt a touch so real
[00:42.22]I will no longer be a transient when I see smiles with tears
[00:50.00]If I have never known the sore of farewell and pain of sacrifices
[00:57.20]What else should I engrave on my mind
[01:03.17]
[01:05.07]Frozen into icy rocks, that's how it starts
[01:12.08]Crumbled like the sands of time, that's how it ends
[01:19.10]Every page of tragedy is thrown away burned out in the flame
[01:31.19]
[01:32.05]A shoulder for the past
[01:35.02]Let out the cries imprisoned for so long
[01:39.07]A pair of wings for me at this moment
[01:44.00]To soar above this world
[01:46.09]Turn into a shooting star that briefly shines but warms up every heart
[01:54.10]May all the beauty be blessed
[02:01.06]May all the beauty be blessed
[02:08.05]
[02:09.17]I will never go
[02:16.22]There's a way back home
[02:23.06]Brighter than tomorrow and yesterday
[02:30.17]May all the beauty be blessed
[02:36.22]
[02:43.00]Wave good-bye to the past when hope and faith have grown so strong and sound
[02:50.04]Unfold this pair of wings for me again
[02:54.12]To soar above this world
[02:57.00]Turned into a moon that always tells the warmth and brightness of the sun
[03:04.23]May all the beauty be blessed
[03:12.00]May all the beauty be blessed
